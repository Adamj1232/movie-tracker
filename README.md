## Reflection
  - This project was a 3 person group project and our first introduction to React Router, Redux, Express, PostgresSQL and Node. We had around 6 days to work together and produce an operational application.
  - We set out to build an application for users to log in and view the most recently released movies. Once the user is logged in they are able to favorite multiple movies which would be saved to their account. 
  - We used Node, Express and SQL tables to store the users data and favorited movies via our own API's with the assistance of PostgreSQL

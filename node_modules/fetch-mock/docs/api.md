## Mocking calls to `fetch`

#### `mock(matcher, response, options)` or `mock(options)`
Replaces `fetch()` with a stub which records its calls, grouped by route, and optionally returns a mocked `Response` object or passes the call through to `fetch()`. Calls to `.mock()` can be chained.

* `matcher`: Condition for selecting which requests to mock Accepts any of the following
    * `string`: Either
        * an exact url to match e.g. 'http://www.site.com/page.html'
        * '*' to match any url
        * `begin:http://www.site.com/` to match urls beginning with a string
        * `end:.jpg` to match urls ending with a string
        * `glob:http://*.*` to match glob patterns
        * `express:/user/:user` to match [express style paths](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path-to-regexp)
        * [deprecated] if the string begins with a `^`, the string following the `^` must begin the url e.g. '^http://www.site.com' would match 'http://www.site.com' or 'http://www.site.com/page.html'
    * `RegExp`: A regular  expression to test the url against
    * `Function(url, opts)`: A function (returning a Boolean) that is passed the url and opts `fetch()` is called with (or, if `fetch()` was called with one, the `Request` instance)
* `response`: Configures the http response returned by the mock. Can take any of the following values (or be a `Promise` for any of them, enabling full control when testing race conditions etc.)
    * `Response`: A `Response` instance - will be used unaltered
    * `number`: Creates a response with this status
    * `string`: Creates a 200 response with the string as the response body
    * `object`: As long as the object does not contain any of the properties below it is converted into a json string and returned as the body of a 200 response. If any of the properties below are defined it is used to configure a `Response` object
        * `body`: Set the response body (`string` or `object`)
        * `status`: Set the response status (default `200`)
        * `headers`: Set the response headers. (`object`)
        * `throws`: If this property is present then a `Promise` rejected with the value of `throws` is returned
        * `sendAsJson`: This property determines whether or not the request body should be JSON.stringified before being sent (defaults to true).
    * `Function(url, opts)`: A function that is passed the url and opts `fetch()` is called with and that returns any of the responses listed above (or a `Promise` for any of them)
* `options`: A configuration object with all/additional properties to define a route to mock
    * `name`: A unique string naming the route. Used to subsequently retrieve references to the calls, grouped by name. If not specified defaults to `matcher.toString()` *Note: If a non-unique name is provided no error will be thrown (because names are optional, so auto-generated ones may legitimately clash)*
    * `method`: http method to match
    * `headers`: key/value map of headers to match
    * `matcher`: as specified above
    * `response`: as specified above
    * `times`: An integer, `n`, limiting the number of times the matcher can be used. If the route has already been called `n` times the route will be ignored and the call to `fetch()` will fall through to be handled by any other routes defined (which may eventually result in an error if nothing matches it)

#### `once()`
Shorthand for `mock()` which limits to being called one time only. (see `times` option above)

#### `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, `delete()`, `head()`, `patch()`
Shorthands for `mock()` restricted to a particular method *Tip: if you use some other method a lot you can easily define your own shorthands e.g.:*

```
fetchMock.purge = function (matcher, response, options) {
    return this.mock(matcher, response, Object.assign({}, options, {method: 'PURGE'}));
}

```

#### `getOnce()`, `postOnce()`, `putOnce()`, `deleteOnce()`, `headOnce()`, `patchOnce()`
Shorthands for `mock()` restricted to a particular method and that can only be called one time only

#### `catch(response)`
This is used to define how to respond to calls to fetch that don't match any of the defined mocks. It accepts the same types of response as a normal call to `.mock(matcher, response)`. It can also take an arbitrary function to completely customise behaviour of unmatched calls. It is chainable and can be called before or after other calls to `.mock()`. If `.catch() ` is called without any parameters then every unmatched call will receive a `200` response e.g.

```
fetchMock
    .mock('http://my-api.com', 200)
    .catch(503)
```

#### `spy()`
Similar to `catch()`, this records the call history of unmatched calls, but instead of responding with a stubbed response, the request is passed through to native `fetch()` and is allowed to communicate over the network.

#### `sandbox(Promise)` *experimental*
This returns a drop-in mock for fetch which can be passed to other mocking libraries. It implements the full fetch-mock api and maintains its own state independent of other instances, so tests can be run in parallel. e.g.

```
    fetchMock.sandbox().mock('http://domain.com', 200)
```

`sandbox()` can optionally be passed a custom promise implementation. If not provided, the `Promise` global is used.

#### `flush()`
Returns a promise that resolves once all fetches handled by fetch-mock have resolved. Useful for testing code that uses `fetch` but doesn't return a promise.

#### `restore()`
Chainable method that restores `fetch()` to its unstubbed state and clears all data recorded for its calls.

#### `reset()`
Chainable method that clears all data recorded for `fetch()`'s calls

*Note that `restore()` and `reset()` are both bound to fetchMock, and can be used directly as callbacks e.g. `afterEach(fetchMock.restore)` will work just fine. There is no need for `afterEach(function () {fetchMock.restore()})`*

## Analysing how `fetch()` has been called

**For the methods below `matcherName`, if given, should be either the name of a route (see advanced usage below) or equal to `matcher.toString()` for any unnamed route. You _can_ pass in the original regex or function used as a matcher, but they will be converted to strings and used to look up values in fetch-mock's internal maps of calls, rather than used as regexes or functions**

#### `called(matcherName)`
Returns a Boolean indicating whether fetch was called and a route was matched. If `matcherName` is specified it only returns `true` if that particular route was matched.

#### `done(matcherName)`
Returns a Boolean indicating whether fetch was called the expected number of times (or at least once if the route defines no expectation is set for the route). If no `matcherName` is passed it returns `true` if every route has been called the number of expected times.

#### `calls(matcherName)`
Returns an object `{matched: [], unmatched: []}` containing arrays of all calls to fetch, grouped by whether fetch-mock matched them or not. If `matcherName` is specified then only calls to fetch matching that route are returned.

#### `lastCall(matcherName)`
Returns the arguments for the last matched call to fetch

#### `lastUrl(matcherName)`
Returns the url for the last matched call to fetch

#### `lastOptions(matcherName)`
Returns the options for the last matched call to fetch

## Utilities

#### `configure(opts)`
Set some global config options, which include
* `sendAsJson` [default `true`] - by default fetchMock will convert objects to JSON before sending. This is overrideable fro each call but for some scenarios e.g. when dealing with a lot of array buffers, it can be useful to default to `false`

#### `setImplementations(opts)`
When using non global fetch (e.g. a ponyfill) or an alternative Promise implementation, this will configure fetch-mock to use your chosen implementations. `opts` is an object with one or more of the following properties: `Headers`,`Request`,`Response`,`Promise`. Note that `setImplementations(require('fetch-ponyfill')())` will configure fetch-mock to use all of fetch-ponyfill's classes.

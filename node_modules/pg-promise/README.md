# About

Built on top of [node-postgres] and its connection pool, this library translates their callback interface into one based on [Promises/A+],
while extending the protocol to a higher level, with automated connections and transactions management.

In addition, the library provides:

* its own, more flexible query formatting;
* event reporting for connectivity, errors, queries and transactions;
* support for all popular promise libraries + ES6 generators;
* declarative approach to controlling query results.

# Installing
```
$ npm install pg-promise
```

# Getting Started

## Initialization

Loading and initializing the library with [Initialization Options]:

```javascript
var pgp = require('pg-promise')({
    // Initialization Options
});
```

&#8722; or without [Initialization Options]:

```javascript
var pgp = require('pg-promise')();
```
 
## Connection

Use one of the two ways to specify database connection details:

* Configuration Object:

```javascript
var cn = {
    host: 'localhost', // server name or IP address;
    port: 5432,
    database: 'my_db_name',
    user: 'user_name',
    password: 'user_password'
};
```

* Connection String:

```javascript
var cn = 'postgres://username:password@host:port/database';
```

Create a global/shared database object from the connection details:

```javascript
var db = pgp(cn);
```

Object `db` represents the database protocol, with lazy database connection, i.e. only the actual query methods acquire
and release the connection. Therefore, you should create only one global/shared `db` object per connection details.

Use of a configuration object has the benefit of being changeable: it is used by the library directly, and changing
properties of the original object will reconnect with the next query.

This library does not use any of the connection's details, it simply passes them on to [PG] when opening a connection.
For more details see pg connection parameters in [WiKi](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/pg#parameters) and
[implementation](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/blob/master/lib/connection-parameters.js).

API: [Database].

## Documentation

[Learn by Example] is the quickest way to get started with this library, while the current document details most of the
basic functionality this library provides.

If you are writing in TypeScript, see [\typescript](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise/tree/master/typescript). 

For the protocol see the [API Documentation], and for everything else - [Wiki pages](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise/wiki).

# Testing

* Clone the repository (or download, if you prefer):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise
```

* Install the library's DEV dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```

* Make sure all tests can connect to your local test database, using the connection details in
[test/db/header.js](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise/blob/master/test/db/header.js).
Either set up your test database accordingly or change the connection details in that file.

* Initialize the database with some test data:
```
$ node test/db/init.js
```

* To run all tests:
```
$ npm test
```

* To run all tests with coverage:
```
$ npm run coverage
```

# Usage

## Queries and Parameters

Every connection context of the library shares the same query protocol, starting with generic method `query`,
defined as shown below:

```javascript
function query(query, values, qrm);
```
* `query` (required) - a string with support for three types of formatting, depending on the `values` passed:
   - format `$1` (single variable), if `values` is of type `string`, `boolean`, `number`, `Date`, `function` or `null`;
   - format `$1, $2, etc..`, if `values` is an array;
   - format `$*propName*`, if `values` is an object (not `null` and not `Date`), where `*` is any of the supported open-close pairs: `{}`, `()`, `<>`, `[]`, `//`;
* `values` (optional) - value/array/object to replace the variables in the query;
* `qrm` - (optional) *Query Result Mask*, as explained below. When not passed, it defaults to `pgp.queryResult.any`.

When a value/property inside array/object is an array, it is treated as a [PostgreSQL Array Type](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/arrays.html),
converted into the array constructor format of `array[]`, the same as calling method `pgp.as.array()`.

When a value/property inside array/object is of type `object` (except for `null`, `Date` or `Buffer`), it is automatically
serialized into JSON, the same as calling method `pgp.as.json()`, except the latter would convert anything to JSON.

For the most current SQL formatting support see method [as.format]

### Raw Text

Raw-text values can be injected by ending the variable name with `^` or `:raw`:
`$1^, $2^, etc...`, `$*varName^*`, where `*` is any of the supported open-close pairs: `{}`, `()`, `<>`, `[]`, `//`

Raw text is injected without any pre-processing, which means:

* No proper escaping (replacing each single-quote symbol `'` with two);
* No wrapping text into single quotes.

Unlike regular variables, value for raw-text variables cannot be `null` or `undefined`, because of the ambiguous meaning
in this case. If such values are passed in, the formatter will throw error `Values null/undefined cannot be used as raw text.` 

Special syntax `this^` within the [Named Parameters](#named-parameters) refers to the formatting object itself, to be injected
as a raw-text JSON-formatted string.

For the most current SQL formatting support see method [as.format]

### Open Values

Open values were added in version 3.4.0, to simplify concatenation of string values within a query,
primarily for such special cases as `LIKE` filters.

Names for open-value variables end with either `:value` or symbol `#`, and it means that such a value
is to be properly formatted and escaped, but not to be wrapped in quotes when it is a text.

Similar to raw-text variables, open-value variables are also not allowed to be `null` or `undefined`, and they
will throw error `Open values cannot be null or undefined.` And the difference is that raw-text variables are not
escaped, while open-value variables are properly escaped.

Below is an example of formatting `LIKE` filter that ends with a value: 

```js
// using $1# or $1:value syntax:
query("...WHERE name LIKE '%$1#'", "berg");
query("...WHERE name LIKE '%$1:value'", "berg");

// using ${propName#} or ${propName:value} syntax:
query("...WHERE name LIKE '%${filter#}'", {filter: "berg"});
query("...WHERE name LIKE '%${filter:value}'", {filter: "berg"});
```

The formatting protocol has been also extended with method [as.value].

### SQL Names

Introduced in version 3.1.0, this feature simplifies formatting for SQL names/identifiers.

When a variable ends with `~` (tilde) or `:name`, it represents an SQL name or identifier, which must be a text
string of at least 1 character long. Such name is then properly escaped and wrapped in double quotes.

```js
query('INSERT INTO $1~($2~) VALUES(...)', ['Table Name', 'Column Name']);
// => INSERT INTO "Table Name"("Column Name") VALUES(...)

query('SELECT ${column~} FROM ${table~}', {
    column: 'Column Name',
    table: 'Table Name'
});
// => SELECT "Column Name" FROM "Table Name"
```

Relying on this type of formatting for sql names and identifiers, along with regular variable formatting
makes your application impervious to sql injection.

See methods: [as.name], [as.format]

## Query Result Mask

In order to eliminate the chances of unexpected query results and thus make the code more robust,
method `query` uses parameter `qrm` (Query Result Mask):

```js
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Query Result Mask flags;
//
// Any combination is supported, except for one + many.
var queryResult = {
    /** Single row is expected. */
    one: 1,
    /** One or more rows expected. */
    many: 2,
    /** Expecting no rows. */
    none: 4,
    /** many|none - any result is expected. */
    any: 6
};
```

In the following generic-query example we indicate that the call can return anything:
```javascript
db.query('select * from users');
```
which is equivalent to making one of the following calls:
```javascript
var qrm = pgp.queryResult;
db.query('select * from users', undefined, qrm.many | qrm.none);
db.query('select * from users', undefined, qrm.any);
db.manyOrNone('select * from users');
db.any('select * from users');
```

This usage pattern is facilitated through result-specific methods that can be used instead of the generic query:

```javascript
db.many(query, values); // expects one or more rows
db.one(query, values); // expects a single row
db.none(query, values); // expects no rows
db.any(query, values); // expects anything, same as `manyOrNone`
db.oneOrNone(query, values); // expects 1 or 0 rows
db.manyOrNone(query, values); // expects anything, same as `any`
```

There is however one specific method `result(query, values)` to bypass any result verification, and instead resolve
with the original [Result] object passed from the [PG] library.

You can also add your own methods and properties to this protocol via the [extend](#extend) event.  

Each query function resolves its **data** according to the `qrm` that was used:

* `none` - **data** is `undefined`. If the query returns any kind of data, it is rejected.
* `one` - **data** is a single object. If the query returns no data or more than one row of data, it is rejected.
* `many` - **data** is an array of objects. If the query returns no rows, it is rejected.
* `one`|`none` - **data** is `null`, if no data was returned; or a single object, if one row was returned.
    If the query returns more than one row of data, the query is rejected.
* `many`|`none` - **data** is an array of objects. When no rows are returned, **data** is an empty array.

If you try to specify `one`|`many` in the same query, such query will be rejected without executing it, telling you that such mask is invalid.

If `qrm` is not specified when calling generic `query` method, it is assumed to be `many`|`none` = `any`, i.e. any kind of data expected.

> This is all about writing robust code, when the client specifies what kind of data it is ready to handle on the declarative level,
leaving the burden of all extra checks to the library.

## Named Parameters

The library supports named parameters in query formatting, with the syntax of `$*propName*`, where `*` is any of the following open-close
pairs: `{}`, `()`, `<>`, `[]`, `//`

```javascript
db.query('select * from users where name=${name} and active=$/active/', {
    name: 'John',
    active: true
});
```

The same goes for all types of query methods as well as method [as.format], where `values` can also be an object whose properties can be
referred to by name from within the query.

A valid property name consists of any combination of letters, digits, underscores or `$`, and they are case-sensitive.
Leading and trailing spaces around property names are ignored.

It is important to know that while property values `null` and `undefined` are both formatted as `null`,
an error is thrown when the property doesn't exist at all (except for `partial` replacements - see below).

Version 3.2.0 added support for `partial` replacements within method [as.format], which when used will simply ignore variables that do not
exist in the formatting object.

#### `this` reference

Version 2.3.0 added support for property `this`, as a reference to the formatting object itself,
so it can be inserted as a JSON-formatted string, alongside its properties.

* `${this}` - inserts the object itself as a JSON-formatted string;
* `${this^}` - inserts the object itself as a raw-text JSON-formatted string.

**example:**

```js
var doc = {
    id: 123,
    body: "some text"
};

db.none("INSERT INTO documents(id, doc) VALUES(${id}, ${this})", doc)
    .then(function () {
        // success;
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
        // error;
    });
```    

which will execute:
```
INSERT INTO documents(id, doc) VALUES(123, '{"id":123,"body":"some text"}')
```

Version 3.2.1 and later allows syntax `:json` as an alternative to formatting the value as a JSON string.

**NOTE:** Technically, it is possible in javascript, though not recommended, for an object to contain a property
with name `this`. And in such cases the property's value will be used instead.

## Functions and Procedures

In PostgreSQL stored procedures are just functions that usually do not return anything.

Suppose we want to call function **findAudit** to find audit records by `user_id` and maximum timestamp.
We can make such call as shown below:

```javascript
db.func('findAudit', [123, new Date()])
    .then(function (data) {
        console.log(data); // printing the data returned
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
        console.log(error); // printing the error
    });
```

We passed it `user_id = 123`, plus current Date/Time as the timestamp. We assume that the function signature matches
the parameters that we passed. All values passed are serialized automatically to comply with PostgreSQL type formats.

Method `func` accepts optional third parameter - `qrm` (Query Result Mask), the same as method `query`.

And when you are not expecting any return results, call `db.proc` instead. Both methods return a [Promise] object,
but `db.proc` doesn't take a `qrm` parameter, always assuming it is `one`|`none`.

Summary for supporting procedures and functions:

* `func(query, values, qrm)` - expects the result according to `qrm`
* `proc(query, values)` - calls `func(query, values, qrm.one | qrm.none)`

## Conversion Helpers

The library provides several helper functions to convert javascript types into their proper PostgreSQL presentation that can be passed
directly into queries or functions as parameters. All of such helper functions are located within namespace [pgp.as], and each function
returns a formatted string when successful or throws an error when it fails.

## Custom Type Formatting

When we pass `values` as a single parameter or inside an array, it is verified to be an object
that supports function `formatDBType`, as either its own or inherited. And if the function exists,
its return result overrides both the actual value and the formatting syntax for parameter `query`.

This allows use of your own custom types as formatting parameters for the queries, as well as
overriding formatting for standard object types, such as `Date` and `Array`.

**Example: your own type formatting**
```javascript
function Money(m) {
    this.amount = m;
    this.formatDBType = function () {
        // return a string with 2 decimal points;
        return this.amount.toFixed(2);
    }
}
```

**Example: overriding standard types**
```javascript
Date.prototype.formatDBType = function () {
    // format Date as a local timestamp;
    return this.getTime();
};
```

Function `formatDBType` is allowed to return absolutely anything, including:
* instance of another object that supports its own custom formatting;
* instance of another object that doesn't have its own custom formatting;
* another function, with recursion of any depth;

Please note that the return result from `formatDBType` may even affect the
formatting syntax expected within parameter `query`, as explained below.

If you pass in `values` as an object that has function `formatDBType`,
and that function returns an array, then your `query` is expected to use 
`$1, $2` as the formatting syntax.

And if `formatDBType` in that case returns a custom-type object that doesn't support
custom formatting, then `query` will be expected to use `$*propName*` as the formatting syntax.

### Raw Custom Types

This features allows overriding `raw` flag for the values returned from custom types.

Any custom type or standard type that implements function `formatDBType` can also set
property `_rawDBType = true` to force raw variable formatting on the returned value.

This makes the custom type formatting ultimately flexible, as there is no limitation
as to how a custom type can format its value.

For example, some special types, like UUID, do not have natural presentation in JavaScript,
so they have to be converted into text strings when passed into the query formatting.
For an array of UUID-s, for instance, you would have to explicitly cast the formatted value
with `::uuid[]` appended at the end of the variable.
  
You can implement your own presentation for UUID that does not require extra casting:

```javascript  
function UUID(value) {
    this.uuid = value;
    this._rawDBType = true; // force raw format on output;
    this.formatDBType = function () {
        // alternatively, you can set flag
        // _rawDBType during this call:
        // this._rawDBType = true;
        return this.uuid;
    };
}
``` 
  
When you chain one custom-formatting type to return another one, please note that
setting `_rawDBType` on any level will set the flag for the entire chain.

## Query Files
  
Version 2.9.0 introduced support for Query Files to increase productivity of developing SQL queries. 

Example:

```js
function sql(file) {
    return new pgp.QueryFile(file, {minify: true});
}

// Create QueryFile globally, once per file:
var sqlFindUser = sql('./sql/findUser.sql');

db.one(sqlFindUser, {id: 123})
    .then(user=> {
        console.log(user);
    })
    .catch(error=> {
        if (error instanceof pgp.minify.SQLParsingError) {
            // => failed to parse the SQL file
        }
    });
```
  
File `findUser.sql`:
```sql
/*
    multi-line comment
*/
SELECT name, dob -- single-line comment
FROM Users
WHERE id = ${id}
```

Every query method of the library recognizes type `QueryFile` as a query provider.

You should only create a single instance of `QueryFile` per file, and then use that instance throughout the application.

Most useful features of class `QueryFile`:

* `debug` mode, to make every query request check if the file has changed since it was last read, and if so - read it afresh.
  This way you can write sql queries and see immediate updates without having to restart your application.
* Added in v3.2.0: `params` option for static SQL pre-formatting, to inject certain values only once, like a schema name or a
  configurable table name.

The query provider itself never throws any error, leaving it for query methods to reject with.

For detailed documentation see [QueryFile API].

## Connections

The library supports promise-chained queries on shared and detached connections. Choosing which one to use depends on the
situation and personal preferences.

### Detached Connections

Queries in a detached promise chain maintain connection independently, they each acquire a connection from the pool,
execute the query and then release the connection back to the pool.

```javascript
db.one('select * from users where id = $1', 123) // find the user from id;
    .then(function (data) {
        // find 'login' records for the user found:
        return db.query('select * from audit where event=$1 and userId=$2',
            ['login', data.id]);
    })
    .then(function (data) {
        console.log(data); // display found audit records;
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
        console.log(error); // display the error;
    });
```
In a situation where a single request is to be made against the database, a detached chain is the only one that makes sense.
And even if you intend to execute multiple queries in a chain, keep in mind that even though each will use its own connection,
such will be used from a connection pool, so effectively you end up with the same connection, without any performance penalty.

### Shared Connections

**NOTE:** With the addition of [Tasks](#tasks), use of shared connections directly is considered obsolete.
It is recommended that you use [Tasks](#tasks) instead, as they are much easier and safer to use.

A promise chain with a shared connection starts with `connect()`, which acquires a connection from the pool to be shared
with all the queries down the promise chain. The connection must be released back to the pool when no longer needed.

```javascript
var sco; // shared connection object;
db.connect()
    .then(function (obj) {
        sco = obj; // save the connection object;
        // find active users created before today:
        return sco.query('select * from users where active=$1 and created < $2',
            [true, new Date()]);
    })
    .then(function (data) {
        console.log(data); // display all the user details;
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
        console.log(error); // display the error;
    })
    .finally(function () {
        if (sco) {
            sco.done(); // release the connection, if it was successful;
        }
    });
```

Shared-connection chaining is when you want absolute control over the connection, either because you want to execute lots of queries in one go,
or because you like squeezing every bit of performance out of your code. Other than that, the author hasn't seen any performance difference
from the detached-connection chaining. And besides, any long sequence of queries normally resides inside a task or transaction, which always
uses shared-connection chaining automatically.

### Tasks

A task represents a shared connection to be used within a callback function. The callback can be either a regular function or an ES6 generator.

A transaction, for example, is just a special type of task, wrapped in `CONNECT->COMMIT/ROLLBACK`. 

```javascript
db.task(function (t) {
    // t = this;
    // execute a chain of queries;
})
    .then(function (data) {
        // success;
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
        // failed;    
    });
```

The purpose of tasks is simply to provide a shared connection context within the callback function to execute and return
a promise chain, and then automatically release the connection.

In other words, it is to simplify the use of [shared connections](#shared-connections), so instead of calling `connect` in the beginning
and `done` in the end (if it was connected successfully), one can call `db.task` instead, execute all queries within
the callback and return the result.

## Transactions

Transactions can be executed within both shared and detached promise chains in the same way, performing the following actions:

1. Acquires a new connection (detached chains only);
2. Executes `BEGIN` command;
3. Invokes your callback function (or generator) with the connection object;
4. Executes `COMMIT`, if the callback resolves, or `ROLLBACK`, if the callback rejects;
5. Releases the connection (detached chains only);
6. Resolves with the callback result, if success; rejects with the reason, if failed.

### Detached Transactions

```javascript
db.tx(function (t) {
    // t = this;
    // creating a sequence of transaction queries:
    var q1 = this.none('update users set active=$1 where id=$2', [true, 123]);
    var q2 = this.one('insert into audit(entity, id) values($1, $2) returning id',
        ['users', 123]);

    // returning a promise that determines a successful transaction:
    return this.batch([q1, q2]); // all of the queries are to be resolved;
})
    .then(function (data) {
        console.log(data); // printing successful transaction output;
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
        console.log(error); // printing the error;
    });
```

A detached transaction acquires a connection and exposes object `t`=`this` to let all containing queries
execute on the same connection.

### Shared-connection Transactions

**NOTE:** Use of shared-connection transactions is no longer necessary. When a transaction needs
to use the connection from its container, you should execute it inside a task instead.  

```js
var sco; // shared connection object;
db.connect()
    .then(function (obj) {
        sco = obj;
        return sco.oneOrNone('select * from users where active=$1 and id=$1', [true, 123]);
    })
    .then(function (data) {
        return sco.tx(function (t) {
            // t = this;
            var q1 = this.none('update users set active=$1 where id=$2', [false, data.id]);
            var q2 = this.one('insert into audit(entity, id) values($1, $2) returning id',
                ['users', 123]);

            // returning a promise that determines a successful transaction:
            return this.batch([q1, q2]); // all of the queries are to be resolved;
        });
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
        console.log(error); // printing the error;
    })
    .finally(function () {
        if (sco) {
            sco.done(); // release the connection, if it was successful;
        }
    });
```

If you need to execute just one transaction, the detached transaction pattern is all you need.
But even if you need to combine it with other queries in a detached chain, it will work the same.
As stated earlier, choosing a shared chain over a detached one is mostly a matter of special requirements
and/or personal preference.

### Nested Transactions

Similar to the shared-connection transactions, nested transactions automatically share the connection between all levels.
This library sets no limitation as to the depth (nesting levels) of transactions supported.

Example:

```javascript
db.tx(function (t) {
    // t = this;
    var queries = [
        this.none('drop table users;'),
        this.none('create table users(id serial not null, name text not null)')
    ];
    for (var i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
        queries.push(this.none('insert into users(name) values($1)', 'name-' + i));
    }
    queries.push(
        this.tx(function (t1) {
            // t1 = this != t;
            return this.tx(function (t2) {
                // t2 = this != t1 != t;
                return this.one('select count(*) from users');
            });
        }));
    return this.batch(queries);
})
    .then(function (data) {
        console.log(data); // printing transaction result;
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
        console.log(error); // printing the error;
    });
```

#### Limitations

It is important to know that PostgreSQL doesn't have proper support for nested transactions, it only
supports *partial rollbacks* via [savepoints](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/sql-savepoint.html) inside transactions.
The difference between the two techniques is huge, as explained further.

Proper support for nested transactions means that the result of a successful sub-transaction isn't rolled back
when its parent transaction is rolled back. But with PostgreSQL save-points, if you roll-back the top-level
transaction, the result of all inner save-points is also rolled back.

Save-points are only good for *partial rollbacks*, i.e. you can roll-back results of sub-transactions, with
yet successful *commit* for the top-level transaction. Using promises it is easy to construct your transaction
so it would utilize that logic. This library automatically provides a transaction on the top level, and
save-points for all sub-transactions.

### Synchronous Transactions

A regular task/transaction with a set of independent queries relies on method [batch] to resolve
all queries asynchronously.

However, when it comes to executing a significant number of queries during a bulk `INSERT` or `UPDATE`,
such approach is no longer practical. For one thing, it implies that all requests have been created as promise objects,
which isn't possible when dealing with a huge number of queries, due to memory limitations imposed by NodeJS.
And for another, when one query fails, the rest will continue trying to execute, due to their promise nature,
as being asynchronous.

This is why within each task/transaction we have method [sequence], to be able to execute a strict
sequence of queries one by one, and if one fails - the rest won't try to execute.

```js
function source(index, data, delay) {
    // must create and return a promise object dynamically,
    // based on the index of the sequence;
    switch (index) {
        case 0:
            return this.query('select 0');
        case 1:
            return this.query('select 1');
        case 2:
            return this.query('select 2');
    }
    // returning or resolving with undefined ends the sequence;
    // throwing an error will result in a reject;
}

db.tx(function (t) {
    // t = this;
    return this.sequence(source);
})
    .then(function (data) {
        console.log(data); // print result;
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
        console.log(error); // print the error;
    });
```

Sequence is based on implementation of [spex.sequence].

### Configurable Transactions

In order to be able to fine-tune database requests in a highly asynchronous environment,
PostgreSQL supports *Transaction Snapshots*, plus 3 ways of configuring a transaction:

* [SET TRANSACTION](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/sql-set-transaction.html), to configure the current transaction,
which your can execute as the very first query in your transaction function;
* `SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION` - setting default transaction properties for the entire session; 
* [BEGIN](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/sql-begin.html) + `Transaction Mode` - initiates a pre-configured transaction.

The first method is quite usable, but that means you have to start every transaction with
an initial query to configure the transaction, which can be a bit awkward.

The second approach isn't very usable within a database framework as this one, which relies
on a connection pool, so you don't really know when a new connection is created.

The last method is not usable, because transactions in this library are automatic, executing `BEGIN`
without your control, or so it was until version 2.5.0, which changed that, as explained further.

---  

Version 2.5.0 added support for [Transaction Mode], which can extend `BEGIN` in your transaction with
a complete set of configuration parameters.

```js
var TransactionMode = pgp.txMode.TransactionMode;
var isolationLevel = pgp.txMode.isolationLevel;
 
// Create a reusable transaction mode (serializable + read-only + deferrable):
var tmSRD = new TransactionMode({
    tiLevel: isolationLevel.serializable,
    readOnly: true,
    deferrable: true
});

function myTransaction() {
    return this.query('SELECT * FROM table');
}

myTransaction.txMode = tmSRD; // assign transaction mode;

db.tx(myTransaction)
    .then(function(){
        // success;
    });
```

Instead of the default `BEGIN`, such transaction will initiate with the following command:
```
BEGIN ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE READ ONLY DEFERRABLE
```

Transaction Mode is set via property `txMode` on the transaction function.

This is the most efficient and best-performing way of configuring transactions. In combination with
*Transaction Snapshots* you can make the most out of transactions in terms of performance and concurrency.

## Generators

Version 2.6.0 added support for ES6 generators. If you prefer writing asynchronous code in a synchronous manner,
you can implement your tasks and transactions as generators. 

```js
function * getUser(t) {
    // t = this;
    let user = yield this.oneOrNone('select * from users where id=$1', 123);
    return yield user || this.one('insert into users(name) values($1) returning *', 'John');
}

db.task(getUser)
    .then(function (user) {
        // success;
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
        // error;
    });
```

The library verifies whether the callback function is a generator, and executes it accordingly.

# Advanced

## Initialization Options

When initializing the library, you can pass object `options` with a set of global properties.
See [API / options](http://vitaly-t.github.io/pg-promise/module-pg-promise.html) for complete list of supported options.

---
#### pgFormatting

By default, **pg-promise** provides its own implementation of the query formatting,
as explained in [Queries and Parameters](#queries-and-parameters).

If, however, you want your queries formatted by the [PG] library, set parameter `pgFormatting`
to be `true` when initializing the library, and every query formatting will redirect to the [PG]'s implementation.

Although this has a huge implication to the library's functionality, it is not within the scope of this project to detail.
For any further reference you should use documentation of the [PG] library.

Note the following formatting features implemented by [pg-promise] that are not in [node-postgres]:
* [Custom Type Formatting](#custom-type-formatting)
* Single-value formatting: [pg-promise] doesn't require use of an array when passing a single value;
* [Raw-Text](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise/wiki/Learn-by-Example#raw-text) support: injecting raw/pre-formatted text values into the query;
* Functions as formatting parameters, with the actual values returned from the callbacks;
* [PostgreSQL Array Constructors](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/arrays.html#ARRAYS-INPUT) are used when formatting arrays,
not the old string syntax;
* Automatic conversion of numeric `NaN`, `+Infinity` and `-Infinity` into their string presentation;
* Support for [this reference](#this-reference);

**NOTE:** Formatting parameters for calling functions (methods `func` and `proc`) is not affected by this override.
When needed, use the generic `query` instead to invoke functions with redirected query formatting.

---
#### promiseLib

By default, **pg-promise** uses ES6 Promise. If your version of NodeJS doesn't support ES6 Promise,
or you want a different promise library to be used, set this property to the library's instance.

Example of switching over to [Bluebird]:
```javascript
var promise = require('bluebird');
var options = {
    promiseLib: promise
};
var pgp = require('pg-promise')(options);
```

[Promises/A+] libraries that implement a recognizable promise signature and work automatically:

* **ES6 Promise** - used by default, though it doesn't have `done()` or `finally()`.
* [Bluebird] - best alternative all around;
* [Promise] - very solid library;
* [When] - quite old, not the best support;
* [Q] - most widely used;
* [RSVP] - doesn't have `done()`, use `finally/catch` instead
* [Lie] - doesn't have `done()`. 

If you pass in a library that doesn't implement a recognizable promise signature, **pg-promise** will
throw error `Invalid promise library specified.` during initialization.

For such libraries you can use [Promise Adapter] to make them compatible with **pg-promise**,
mostly needed by smaller and simplified [Conformant Implementations](https://promisesaplus.com/implementations). 

## Library de-initialization

When exiting your application, you can make the following call:
```javascript
pgp.end();
```
This will release [pg] connection pool globally and make sure that the process terminates without any delay.
If you do not call it, your process may be waiting for 30 seconds (default for [poolIdleTimeout](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/blob/master/lib/defaults.js#L31)),
waiting for the connection to expire in the pool.

If, however you normally exit your application by killing the NodeJS process, then you don't need to use it.
